3. MULTI-DEVICE SUPPORT & RESPONSIVENESS
   Problem: Layout may break on very small or very large screens
   Solution: Enhanced responsive design testing

   Test Targets:
   - iPhone SE (375px width)
   - iPad (768px width)
   - Desktop 4K (3840px width)
   - Foldable phones (unfolded: 884px)

   Improvements Needed:
   - Question text truncation on mobile
   - Image scaling in flashcards
   - Statistics graphs responsive sizing
   - Deck selector overflow handling

   Tools:
   - BrowserStack for device testing
   - Playwright for automated responsive tests

   Estimated Effort: 1 week

5. ENHANCED STATISTICS & ANALYTICS
   Current: Basic counts and averages
   Needed: Actionable insights

   New Statistics:
   - Heatmap Calendar (GitHub-style)
     * Study activity over time
     * Streak tracking
     * Highlight missed days

   - Retention Curve
     * Graph showing memory decay
     * Predicted forgetting curve
     * Optimal review time indication

   - Deck Difficulty Analysis
     * Average easiness factor
     * "Problem cards" identification
     * Time-to-mastery estimation

   - Study Efficiency
     * Cards per minute
     * Accuracy over time
     * Peak performance hours

   Implementation:
   - Add recharts library back (needed for graphs)
   - Create src/components/AdvancedStatistics.tsx
   - Store session data with timestamps
   - Calculate streaks from DailyStats

   Libraries to Add:
   - recharts (graphs)
   - date-fns (date manipulation)
   - react-calendar-heatmap (activity calendar)

   Estimated Effort: 2 weeks

12. IMPORT FROM POPULAR SOURCES
    Current: Manual entry only
    Needed: Import from:
    - Anki (.apkg files)
    - Quizlet (via CSV export)

    Implementation:
    - Create src/services/importers/
    - File type detection
    - Parser for each format
    - Mapping wizard UI

    Estimated Effort: 2 weeks
